# Car robot controlled from iOS



## Description
The project represents a robot car, easily built at home. The project consists of an iOS application done in Swift, that allows the user to control the car from the app and an Arduino application done in Arduino 1.8 that runs the program on the Arduino UNO R3 board.


## Visuals
The user manual and the documentation for the project can be found here.

## Instalation
To make everything work, you first need the car built (the circuit can be found in the documentation). Second step is to have the app installed on the iOS device, connect to the bluetooth module. Third step is having fun by accessing Settings -> Wanna play and control the robot as you want. The entire user manual can be found in the documentation. 

## Suport
For every single question about how to use / build the project, you can e-mail me at: [dan_mar_chis@yahoo.com]()

## Roadmap
In the future I will add another functionality to the robot car which will be "light following".

## Contributing
Every single contribute to the project is going to be appreciated and I also encourage you to do this. The bluetooth connection and the base template of the application is inspired from "hoiberg" and the template can be found on github.
